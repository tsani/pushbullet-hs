Pushbullet in Haskell
=====================

This repository contains two packages:

* `servant-pushbullet-client`: bindings to the Pushbullet API using
  `servant-client`
* `pushbullet-types`: datatypes used by the Pushbullet API.

See their respective subdirectories for more details.

Before commit 789866e, tags refer to versioned releases of
`pushbullet-types`. After that commit, tags have a prefix to specify which
package the version refers to.
